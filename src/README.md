# mortar-tabs-component

### _A basic tabs web component_ ###

This is a simple web component for building tabbed interfaces. Heavily inspired by [Brick](http://mozbrick.github.io/)'s [brick-tabbar](https://github.com/mozbrick/brick-tabbar) but doesn't get as complex. Not using Shadow DOM, and not using HTML imports, so it can be used by just including some `.js` and `.css` files in your code.

Its main goal is to be used in [Mortar](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar/)'s [TabView](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-tab-view) template, but you can use it in your projects too if you don't need a full featured component.

Bear in mind this is still under development so there are gaps and very probably errors and bugs too O:-)
